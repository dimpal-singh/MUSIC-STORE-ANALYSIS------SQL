Welcome to the SQL project focused on analyzing an online music store's dataset. This project is designed with beginners in mind and aims to provide an opportunity to learn how to work with SQL queries to analyze a music playlist database. By using SQL, you'll gain insights into various aspects of the music store's data and contribute to the understanding of its business growth trajectory.

This project was developed using PostgreSQL and managed through pgAdmin 4, a popular open-source administration and management tool for PostgreSQL databases.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how SQL queries and various advanced techniques can be applied to a real-world dataset to derive meaningful insights. The dataset used in this project represents an online music store's information, including details about songs, albums, customers, purchases, and more.


# Tools Used
Database Management System (DBMS): PostgreSQL
Database Administration Tool: pgAdmin 4

# Key Concepts and Techniques Applied
SQL Queries and Joins: Utilized SQL queries and different types of joins to combine data from multiple tables efficiently.
Subqueries: Employed subqueries to retrieve data based on the results of another query.
Inner Queries: Utilized inner queries to extract specific data from the database.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Created CTEs to simplify complex queries and improve readability.
Recursive Queries: Explored recursive queries to solve hierarchical problems within the dataset.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into different levels of complexity:

Easy: Answered straightforward questions using basic SQL queries and simple joins.
Moderate: Tackled more complex questions involving subqueries and intermediate-level joins.
Advanced: Addressed advanced analytical questions using techniques like CTEs and recursive queries.


# Getting Started
To replicate or explore this project on your own, follow these steps:

Database Setup: Set up a PostgreSQL database and load the provided music store dataset.
Tool Installation: Install pgAdmin 4 to manage the database and execute SQL queries.
Queries: Open the SQL files for each level (Easy, Moderate, Advanced) and execute the queries to get the answers.

# Project Benefits
By completing this project, you will:

Gain familiarity with SQL querying and database manipulation.
Understand how to use different types of joins and subqueries effectively.
Learn about advanced techniques like CTEs and recursive queries for complex problems.
Develop confidence in working with real-world datasets and drawing insights from them.
Remember that this project is designed to be a learning experience, so feel free to experiment, make mistakes, and refine your SQL skills along the way.

Note: If you face any challenges or have questions while working on this project, don't hesitate to seek help from online resources, forums, or communities.
